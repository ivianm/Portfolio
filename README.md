## Projects
### Car Prices - Linear Regression
[Github](https://github.com/ivianm/portfolio/blob/main/projects/car-prices-linear-regression.ipynb)

In this project a linear regression model was developed to understand the drivers which influence car prices.

Skills/libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels

### Credit Card Default - Classification
[Github](https://github.com/ivianm/portfolio/blob/main/projects/credit-card-default-classification.ipynb)

The objective of this project is to predict whether or not a credit card client will default for their payment in the next month. 
Two classifiers were explored - Random Forest and KNN Classifier - and it was determined the best of a given set of hyperparameters by using grid search.

Skills/libraries: numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn

### Electricity Demand - Clustering
[Github](https://github.com/ivianm/portfolio/blob/main/projects/electricity-demand-clustering.ipynb)

A study of the electricity demand from clients in Portugal during 2013 and 2014 was conducted.
Clustering techniques were used (k-means algorithm) to understand the typical usage behaviour during 2013-2014.

Skills/libraries: scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

### MNIST Dataset - Dimensionality Reduction
[Github](https://github.com/ivianm/portfolio/blob/main/projects/mnist-dataset-dimensionality-reduction.ipynb)

The aim of this project is to perform dimensionality reduction of features using PCA and compare classification on the reduced dataset to that of original one.
The algorithm used was Random Forest classification and the dimensionality reduction techniques were t-SNE and LLE.

Skills/libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn

### Customer Default Payments - Decision Trees and Ensemble Models
[Github](https://github.com/ivianm/portfolio/blob/main/projects/customer-default-payments-decision-trees-and-ensemble-models.ipynb)

We will use Classification Trees for predicting if a user has a default payment option active or not. This dataset is aimed at the case of customer default payments in Taiwan. we will use decision trees to make predictions, and RandomGrid for hyper-parameters tuning for decision trees. We will also explore the effectiveness of ensemble algorithms (Random Forest, Adaboost, Extra trees classifier, Gradient Boosted Tree).

Skills/libraries: numpy, pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, matplotlib, scipy

### MNIST, Iris Plant Dataset - KNN Algorithm
[Github](https://github.com/ivianm/portfolio/blob/main/projects/mnist-iris-plant-dataset-knn-algorithm.ipynb)

This is a simple implementation of the sklearn KNN model using the MNIST dataset and reimplementation of this code but with the Iris plants dataset.

Skills/libraries: scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib, pandas

### Auto Insurance Regression Analysis
[Github](https://github.com/ivianm/portfolio/blob/main/projects/auto-insurance-regression-analysis.ipynb)

In this project, we will be building two regression models (linear regression and decision tree regression) to predict the total claim amount using the input features of the dataset.

Skills/libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, scikit-learn

### Data Exploration - Spark
[Github](https://github.com/ivianm/portfolio/blob/main/projects/data-exploration-spark.py)

In this project, we will explore how to process IoT Device JSON Data using dataset PySpark

Skills/libraries: PySpark SQL, pandas

### Diamond Price - Spark ML
[Github](https://github.com/ivianm/portfolio/blob/main/projects/diamond-price-spark-ml.py)

Using the Apache Spark ML pipeline, we will build a model to predict the price of a diamond based on the available features.

Skills/libraries: PySpark SQL, PySpark ML
